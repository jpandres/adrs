# 2. Use adr-tools and wait for fixes

Date: 2022-07-07

## Status

Superseded by [3. Fork adr-tools](0003-fork-adr-tools.md)

## Context

Although the idea of ADR and documenting them can be done manually, a tool to facilitate the process would be beneficial to get better adoption
## Decision

Use the tool created by the author that came up with the idea of ADR [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools)
This is a simple set of bash scripts that you use locally to create ADRs with templates

## Consequences

- The tool have some bugs
- The repo haven't been updated in years...it might never happen again.
