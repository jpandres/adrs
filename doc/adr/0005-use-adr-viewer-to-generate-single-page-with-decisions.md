Date: 2022-07-07

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Going thgough every markdown file with the ADRs is not very user friendly, specially for non-developers. Something else is needed 

## Decision

After evaluating a couple of tools, https://github.com/mrwilson/adr-viewer is the choosen one given it's simplicity.

## Consequences

- Dependency with open source product that is not highly active.
